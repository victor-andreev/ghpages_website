## 1. Data Description
Data consist of pair-end Illumina reads (150 bp; Illumina HiSeq 4000) for 234 *Asclepias* individuals.

## 2. Data Collection
The genomic sequences for the *Asclepias*  samples were obtained by extracting DNA from plant tissue using the Qiagen DNeasy kit and sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq platform.

## 3. Data Storage and Backup
All project-related files are stored on a remote server and regularly backed up on an external hard drive.

## 4. Data Organization and Documentation
Corresponding sample location, collector name, and the accompanying metadata will be made available upon publication.

## 5. Data Preservation and Long-Term Access
All data sets used in the project are (or will be) deposited at the Genbank Short Read Archive and FigShare.

## 6. Data Sharing and Access
The raw sequencing data are publicly available on the SRA under the BioProject PRJNA988843 Genbank.

## 7. Data Ethics and Legal Compliance
No ethics approval was needed for this study.

## 8. Roles and Responsibilities
Participants: Joshua Puzey, Elizabeth Davies, Carrie Olson-Manning, Sydney Kreutzmann, and Mark Fishbein.  
V. A. and C. O-M. and S. K. performed fieldwork, and V. A., L.D. and S.K. generated sequence data. V. A. analyzed the data.

## 9. Budget and Resources
Several grant sourses provided funding for sequensing effort and data storage.

This Data Management Plan ensures responsible collection, storage, and sharing of short read sequensing data. It promotes the transparency, reproducibility, and accessibility of population genetics and hybridization research.
